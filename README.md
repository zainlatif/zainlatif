# Hi, I'm Zain Latif

I'm currently working as a data analyst, ML trainer, and full-stack developer. I'm at an entry-level position and still learning — I prefer to keep things honest and simple rather than presenting myself as overly experienced or highly professional. I'm focused on building practical skills, teaching others, and contributing to projects as I grow.

## Tech Stack

- Data & ML: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy
- Visualization & BI: Power BI ![Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Power%20BI-F2C811?logo=microsoft-power-bi&logoColor=white)
- Databases & Querying: SQL
- Web & Full-Stack: JavaScript, React, Node.js
- Tools: Git, Docker

## About

- Role: Data Analyst • ML Trainer • Full-stack Developer (entry-level)
- Approach: Practical, curious, and collaborative — I enjoy learning by doing and helping others understand concepts.
